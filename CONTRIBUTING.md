## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
- If you've never contributed before, see [the first timer's guide on Auth0 Blog](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/) for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our repositorties are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement for the project. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo for your change.

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account.
2. Clone the project to your machine (`git clone https://github.com/GDGAlgiers/nest-init`)
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name (`git checkout -b feature/githubName/AmazingFeature`)
4. Commit changes to the branch (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo.
6. Push changes to your fork (`git push origin feature/githubName/AmazingFeature`)
7. Open a PR in our repository.
